Here is a repository for exploring the results of the preprint at [link to come]().  The main parts are:

- the notebook [figures.ipynb](figures.ipynb), which will recreate all the figures in the paper.
- A [web site](http://54.211.36.187/app), which will make more sense after you either read the paper or look at the notebook below...
- the notebook [introduction.ipynb](introduction.ipynb), where I took a stab at making a summary of the paper that I hope is accessible to non-scientists, and might be enough to get the main idea of the paper and understand what the website is about.

Please contact me with thoughts or questions!
